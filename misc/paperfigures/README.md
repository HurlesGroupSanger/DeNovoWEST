# README for code to recreate paper figures  

In this directory, we provide the code to recreate most of the main text figures from [Kaplanis, Samocha, Wiel, Zhang et al Nature 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2832-5). We provide Rmarkdowns for the four main text figures and, in a separate directory, the R code to generate the results depicted in Figure 4b (the model of remaining PTV burden; see paper for more details).  

Required R libraries:    
* data.table  
* dplyr  
* ggbeeswarm  
* ggplot2  
* ggrepl  
* rateratio.test  
* RColorBrewer  
* reshape2 (if you want to run the modle code in `Figure4_code_for_model`)  
* tidyr   
* wesanderson
