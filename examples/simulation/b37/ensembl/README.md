# Description

This folder contains the rates (subset), DNM and weights files used in DNW v1 for the publication.
The files have been adapted to DNW 2 new format but their content is the same.

The folder is named ensembl because for v1, rates file was created querying the Ensembl database rather than using a gff file (v2)
