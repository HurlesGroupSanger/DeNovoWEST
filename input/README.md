`DDD_RUMC_GDX_denovos_2019_05_15__wweights.txt.gz`

45,221 *de novo* mutations (DNMs) from 31,058 developmental disorder patients.

`alt`: Alternative allele of the DNM
`altprop_child`: Fraction of reads that are from the alternative allele
`chrom`: Chromosome of the DNM
`consequence`: Mutation consequence of the DNM () ????
`cq`: Mutation consequence of the DNM (e.g. missense, synonymous)
`hgnc_id`: HGNC ID
`id`: Proband ID
`maf`: Minor allele frequency in ???
`pos`: Position of the DNM
`prob`: ??
`raw`: CADD version 1.0 raw score
`ref`: Reference allele of the DNM
`score`: CADD version 1.0 Phred score
`study`: Cohort of the proband with the DNM
`symbol`: HGNC symbol
`constrained`: Whether the DNM is in a missense constrained region (if stop_gained or missense) or in a gene with evidence of regional missense constraint (other mutation types)
